ViewPager Indicator App Template
================================

This is a template for an Android application using a ViewPager indicator
in title mode (a.k.a swipey tabs) to switch between fragments.


Required libraries
------------------

The following libraries are used in this application:

* ActionBarSherlock_: an extension of the support library designed to
  facilitate the use of the action bar design pattern across all versions
  of Android with a single API.

* ViewPagerIndicator_: paging indicator widgets compatible with the ViewPager
  from the Android Support Library and ActionBarSherlock.
